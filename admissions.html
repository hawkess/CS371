                The School of Art requires for admission a high degree of capability and commitment. Applicants must hold a bachelor’s degree from an accredited college or university or a diploma from a four-year accredited professional art school. In exceptional cases and most particularly in light of the differences among educational structures and opportunities in the international art world today, the admissions committee may waive these prerequisites if other proofs of preparation and accomplishment are deemed sufficient equivalents by the committee. In either case, admission to the School of Art is on a highly selective and competitive basis.

                    <div class="sans-serif">
                        <p>The online application for programs beginning in the 2020–2021 academic year opened on October 1, 2019. All applications for Fall 2020 must be submitted no later than 11:59:59 PM – EST on <span class="font-weight-bold">Friday, January 10, 2020</span>.</p>

                        <p>Please note that Yale School or Art practices need-blind admission, and therefore <span class="font-weight-bold">does not waive admission application fees.</span> The non-refundable fee to apply is $100.</p>

                        <p><span class="font-weight-bold">References and supporting documents:</span> While references and TOEFL scores (if applicable) may continue to be received after the January 10th deadline, review of applications begins soon thereafter. Applicants are thus urged to impress upon those writing reference letters, or submitting items on their behalf, that the timely submission of such documents is critical to guarantee inclusion in the admission committee’s review.</p>

                        <p>Please also note that upon entering an individual as a reference in the application system, a reference request and URL to upload the recommendation letter is automatically sent to the recipient’s email. Applicants who decide to remove a specific reference from their application <span class="font-weight-bold">must notify that individual directly as the link will become inactive.</span></p>

                        <p><span class="font-weight-bold">Application Status:</span> Due to the high volume of incoming applications and processing currently underway, our office is unable to provide application status checks or confirm the receipt of items by phone or by email. Applicants should familiarize themselves with their Yale admission status page (accessed by logging into the application system) which will indicate outstanding items.</p>

                        <p>Receipt of items submitted by digital upload is updated in real time on the application status page checklist. Please allow one week for credentials received by postal mail to be reflected in the status page.</p>

                        <p><span class="font-weight-bold">Admission Decision Notification:</span> First-round admission decisions, which include interview invitations as well as denials, will be sent in early February.</p>

                    <div class="sans-serif">
                        <p>Once an application has been submitted, applicants can track the status of their application and the receipt of required supporting materials (such as recommendations) online. Applicants are encouraged to check the status of their application materials and follow up as necessary.</p>

                        <p>Final Selection</p>

                        <p>Applicants who have passed the <span class="font-weight-bold">Preliminary Selection Jury</span> will be notified in early February. At this time, <span class="font-weight-bold">applicants invited to interview</span> are required to submit official transcripts and send or prepare to bring original work to the School. Individual interviews will be scheduled for mid-late February, depending on the program. The interview is an important component of the final selection process.</p>

                        <p>Guidelines for Interview</p>

                        <p><span class="font-weight-bold">Applicants in Graphic Design</span> should prepare a portfolio of their work in any or all of these areas: graphic design print work, environmental design, broadcast/video graphics, letterform design, interactive media, and other related projects in the visual arts. Applicants are encouraged to present bodies of work that demonstrate special areas of interest. Academic or research papers may also be submitted in support of the application. For two year program applicants at least 12 examples of physical work and for the preliminary program at least 10 examples of physical work may be presented at interview.</p>

                        <p><span class="font-weight-bold">Applicants in Painting/Printmaking</span> should submit no more than four artworks and four drawings, studies, graphic works, or videos (these are not required to be pieces that were in your application portfolio). It is common that finalists remove work from stretchers for ease of travel, and this completely acceptable.
                        </p>
                        <p><span class="font-weight-bold">Applicants in Photography</span> prepare a portfolio of no more than 20 un-matted photographic proofs which are no larger than 20 X 24 inches each.
                        </p>
                        <p><span class="font-weight-bold">Applicants in Sculpture</span> prepare digital files that document the individual’s latest work as well as additional images representing earlier work. Additional documentation to the work in your preliminary portfolio may be brought to your interview (include with portfolio images on a thumb drive for your presentation).Please do not bring any objects for your presentation as the process of setting up takes away from interview time.
                        </p>
                        <p><span class="font-weight-bold">All Applicants</span> All original works shipped to Yale should be accompanied by a complete inventory, and each work should bear the applicant’s name.
                        </p>
                        <p><span class="font-weight-bold">Final notification of admission</span> will be e-mailed in early March. Offers of admission are good only for the year in which they are made. We do not practice deferred admission. The Financial Aid Award letter will be e-mailed shortly after notification of admission. No decisions will be given in person or over the telephone.
                        </p>
                        <p>An individual’s acceptance of admission to the School of Art must be received by <span class="font-weight-bold">April 1</span>. All matriculating students must submit a transcript that certifies their undergraduate degree. Admission is not binding unless this certification is received.
                        </p>
                        <p><span class="font-weight-bold">Return of Work</span> Original Work delivered by hand must be picked up on weekdays during the hours and dates specified. Any hand-delivered work not taken during the specified time will be sent to a commercial warehouse for storage at the applicant’s expense unless other arrangements are made in advance.
                        </p>
                        <p>Work shipped must be prepaid and must be accompanied by a prepaid return shipping label. If you send your work via United Parcel Service, you may purchase a “Call-Tag” for its return from UPS when you make your shipping arrangements. We cannot return or receive COD.

                        <p>Every precaution will be taken to secure the safety of the works submitted for review. However, the School of Art assumes no responsibility for loss or damage to the works from any cause

                <div class="sans-serif">
                    <p>Students are admitted to Yale’s MFA for the Fall semester of each year only. Applicants are notified of the admission committee’s decisions on preliminary selections in early February, and final decisions in early March. No information about decisions will be given over the phone. To apply for more than one area of concentration, separate applications, fees, and supporting documentation must be submitted. The work submitted should be representative of the applicant’s experience in that particular field. Applicants should be advised that applying to more than one program does not increase chances of selection.</p>

                    <p>APPLICATION DEADLINE: Online applications for programs beginning in the 2019–2020 academic year must be uploaded no later than 11:59:59 PM EST on January 10, 2020. Applicants will not be allowed to submit materials or applications after the deadline has passed. Please note that when many applicants are uploading simultaneously near the deadline, it is possible that lengthier processing times will be experienced. To avoid this, please consider submitting prior to the deadline day.</p>

                    <p>Admission Procedures for Preliminary Selection</p>

                    <p>Instructions for All Applicants</p>

                    <p>An application to the School of Art requires forethought and planning. It is important to read all of the application instructions carefully. Following these instructions will ensure that your application is viewed to best advantage.
                    </p>

                    <p>The Yale School of Art application for the 2019–2020 academic year is available online at <a href="https://apply.art.yale.edu/apply/">https://apply.art.yale.edu/apply/</a>. The information that follows will assist you in filing the application online. For an explanation of specific requirements for each area of study, please refer to the departmental sections that follow.
                    </p>

                    <p>Application materials:
                    </p>

                    <p>The following materials are required for consideration of your application for admission:
                    </p>

                    <ol>
                        <li>
                            <p>Submit the online application. Application portal opens on October 1 and may be worked until the January 10 deadline. As it generally takes several weeks to complete an application, it is strongly recommended that applicants prepare their materials early to ensure completion by the deadline.</p>
                        </li>

                        <p>Please note that the School of Art is NOT part of the Yale Graduate School of Arts and Sciences, and it is not possible to apply by using application materials found on the Graduate School’s Web site. It is recommended that you read the online School of Art Bulletin for 2018/2019 before beginning the application process.</p>

                        <li>
                            <p>Nonrefundable application fee of $100. Please follow payment instructions at <a href="https://apply.art.yale.edu/apply/">https://apply.art.yale.edu/apply/</a>. Forms of payment include credit card and checking account.</p>
                        </li>

                        <p>
                            Yale School of Art, in our commitment to equity and access, practices “need blind admission”; meaning that, candidate financial need or ability is never disclosed to the admission committee during review of MFA applications. For this reason, and because the processing and careful review of each individual application demands great time and human resources, we regret that the School does not waive the application fee under any circumstances.</p>

                        <li>
                            <p>A one-page statement that addresses inﬂuences, interests, current work direction, brief life history (as it relates to art/design practice), and reasons for applying to graduate school at this time. Statements should be limited to one page or no more than 500 words.
                                Applicants to the Painting/Printmaking program should make reference in their statements to the “representative work” in the portfolio; this is not critical for the other programs.</p>
                        </li>

                        <li>
                            <p>References from three persons practicing or teaching in the field in which application is made, attesting to the applicant’s ability and competence in that field.</p>
                        </li>
                        <p>
                            NOTE: The admissions committee reviews applications shortly after the deadline. While it is not uncommon for letters of recommendation to come in past the January 10th deadline, please impress upon on those who will be writing on your behalf, that late submission of supporting documentation may risk exclusion from the review. Applicants can always view the receipt status of reference requests on the application status page.</p>

                        <li>
                            <p>Transcripts of academic record for the bachelor’s degree and/or professional art schools attended. Student/unofficial copies may be uploaded to the application for the preliminary jury. Official transcripts will ONLY be required for applicants invited to interview. If invited to interview, official transcripts should be mailed to: Yale School of Art Admissions, POB 208339, New Haven, CT 06520-8339. Neither junior college transcripts nor Graduate Record Examination (GRE) scores are required.</p>
                        </li>

                        <li>
                            <p>Portfolio of work. Applicants who fail to upload a portfolio as outlined by the stated deadline will NOT be considered. The portfolio should represent images of your best work, indicate your current direction, and demonstrate your ability. At least half of the images should represent work done within the last twelve months, and all should be from within the last three years. Chronological order of year is embedded in our system, and you will not be able to override it. The application system used by Yale requires that one image from the portfolio be designated as a “representative work.” This selection is simply the default image for the cover page of each application file. As such, applicants have historically selected the piece which most strongly represents ideas central to their current body of work.</p>

                        <p>International students MUST use their passport name on all application materials.</p>

                        <p>In order to undertake graduate study, all international students and others for whom English is not their first language must present evidence of competence in the use of the English language. This may be done by taking the Internet-based Test of English as a Foreign Language (TOEFL iBT), which is administered by the Educational Testing Service, <a href="http://www.ets.org">www.ets.org</a>. The TOEFL code number for the Yale School of Art is 3982. Candidates for admission generally achieve a composite Internet-based score of at least 100, or a computer-based score of at least 250, with speaking and listening scores of at least 28. If the TOEFL iBT is not available in your area, you are required to complete the TOEFL that is available plus you are required to take the Test of Spoken English (TSE). A minimum TOEFL score of 550 is generally achieved for the pbt. Although we have no official cut-off, you will have difficulty in an intensive program such as ours without a level of language proficiency appropriate for graduate study. IELTS test scores may be accepted with a minimum score of 7. The TOEFL score may be waived if the undergraduate degree has been obtained from a four-year, English-speaking institution.</p>

                        <p>In order to receive visa documentation, admitted international students must submit proof that income from all sources will be sufficient to meet expenses for two years of study. In 2018–2019 annual expenses (including tuition) will amount to $61,640 for a single student. Evidence of funds may come from the following sources:</p>

                        <p>
                            <ul>
                                <li>Affidavit from a bank</li>
                                <li>Copy of an award letter stating that financial assistance has been offered
                                </li>
                                <li>Certification by parents of their ability and intention to provide the necessary funds</li>
                                <li>Certification by employer of anticipated income</li>
                            </ul>
                        </p>
                        <p>All international students who wish to be appointed as teaching assistants during their second year must obtain a United States Social Security number in order to be paid.</p>
